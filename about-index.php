        <h2>About Us</h2>

        <h5>We are JamCris Trading & <span>Machine Surplus</span></h5>
        <p>Founded by three siblings named Jimmy, Alex, and Mercy Crisostomo in 2003, the company formerly known as
          "Almers" has been providing quality products and services for 20 years now. The name "JAMCRIS" was a clever
          combination of the siblings' names and it has become synonymous with excellence and reliability in their
          industry.

          <br><br> Today, our shop is located at Anilao, Malolos, Bulacan and it has become a go-to destination for
          customers looking for top-notch products and services.
